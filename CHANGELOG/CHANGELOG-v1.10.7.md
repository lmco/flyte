# Flyte 1.10.7 Release Notes

We're excited to share the release of Flyte 1.10.7, featuring a broad spectrum of updates, improvements, and bug fixes across the Flyte ecosystem. This release marks a pivotal shift in our development approach, notably with our adoption of [buf](https://github.com/flyteorg/flyte/pull/4806) for protobuf stub generation. This move optimizes our development workflow and discontinues the automatic creation of Java and C++ stubs, making it easier to adapt the generated code for other languages as needed. Additionally, we've upgraded to gRPC-gateway v2, aligning with the latest advancements and recommendations found in the [v2 migration guide](https://grpc-ecosystem.github.io/grpc-gateway/docs/development/grpc-gateway_v2_migration_guide/).

Our sincere gratitude goes to all contributors for their invaluable efforts towards this release.
